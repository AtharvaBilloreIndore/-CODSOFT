TASK 2 : CALCULATOR
Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.
Perform the calculation and display the result.

Solution :-
Here we are asked to design a calculator. So the code for the following will be as follows
CODE:-
def CALCULATOR():
        print("   CALCULATOR   ")
        first_no = float(input("Enter the first number"))
        second_no = float(input("Enter the second number"))

        Addition = first_no + second_no
        Subtraction = first_no - second_no 
        Multiplication = first_no * second_no
        Division = round(first_no / second_no,2)

        print("\nA. Addition")
        print("S. Subtraction")
        print("M. Multiplication")
        print("D. Division")
        print("CE. Clear Entry")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
       
        if choice == 'A':
            print("The sum is",Addition)
        elif choice == 'S':
            print("The difference is",Subtraction)
        elif choice == 'M':
            print("The product is",Multiplication)
        elif choice == 'D':
            print("The Quotient is",Division)
        elif choice == 'CE':
            CALCULATOR()
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
        
CALCULATOR()
